[581.76s] perfect job is hard a stable job that [585.00s] pays the bills is also good i strongly [588.96s] believe in following your dreams your [591.44s] job should be something you're [592.76s] passionate about emily i understand that [596.32s] but we live in a practical world a job [599.44s] needs to provide financial security [601.72s] first true john but don't you think that [605.08s] doing a job just for money can make you [607.20s] unhappy in the long term that's a good [610.04s] point but we must balance dreams with [613.76s] reality stability is important [616.84s] especially if we have families to [619.12s] support what if we start with a stable [621.48s] job and then work on our dream in our [623.00s] spare time that way we can be secure and [626.60s] still chase our dreams that sounds like [629.12s] a practical plan it's about finding a [632.00s] middle path and working towards our [633.88s] dreams even if it takes [641.68s] time that was a great discussion between [644.24s] emily and john about dream jobs and [646.16s] practical jobs what do you think about [648.56s] it do you agree more with emily or with [651.28s] john i'd love to see your opinions in [653.48s] the comments section so please feel free [655.60s] to express your thought let's review [657.72s] some vocabulary from their [660.16s] conversation first passion this means a [663.52s] very strong feeling about something like [666.36s] my passion is playing [670.52s] football [672.28s] practical practical is about being real [674.72s] and useful in daily life learning a [677.64s] second language is a practical [680.92s] skill middle path means finding a [684.00s] balanced approach she balances her [686.40s] career and personal life by following a [688.64s] middle path [691.28s] chase chase is to actively pursue or [694.60s] seek something he chases his goal of [697.60s] becoming a renowned [699.88s] chef finally fulfillment it means [703.08s] feeling happy because you are doing what [705.04s] you want to do for example teaching [708.08s] children gives me a sense of [710.56s] fulfillment now that we've gone through [712.52s] some key vocabulary let's listen to [714.52s] emily and john's conversation one more [716.56s] time pay special attention to the words [718.96s] we've just discussed and see if you can [721.16s] spot them as you [727.40s] listen do you think having a dream job [730.76s] is important john yes emily but finding [734.76s] the perfect job is hard a stable job [738.20s] that pays the bills is also good i [741.96s] strongly believe in following your [743.72s] dreams your job should be something [745.80s] you're passionate about emily i [748.72s] understand that but we live in a [750.84s] practical world a job needs to provide [753.80s] financial security first true john but [757.48s] don't you think that doing a job just [759.52s] for money can make you unhappy in a long [762.36s] that's a good point but we must balance [765.60s] dreams with reality stability is [769.32s] important especially if we have families [771.76s] to support what if we start with a [774.40s] stable job and then work on our dream in [776.20s] our spare time that way we can be secure [779.80s] and still chase our dreams that sounds [782.40s] like a practical plan it's about finding [785.24s] a middle path and working towards our [787.24s] dreams even if it takes [794.92s] time today's talk with emily and john [797.60s] brings up a big question about work what [800.36s] is more important to you doing what you [802.52s] love or earning a lot of money let's [805.04s] think about this first if you do a job [807.96s] you love will it make make you happier [810.04s] even if it doesn't pay much on the other [812.44s] hand is having a job with good pay more [815.00s] important to feel secure and take care [816.80s] of your family i wonder can we find a [819.52s] job that lets us do both follow our [821.52s] passion and earn enough money is it [824.84s] possible to have the best of both worlds [828.56s] in my opinion it's important to find a [830.92s] job that makes you happy but we also [833.48s] need to think about money for our needs

the [1402.48s] family my nieces and nephews they're [1405.88s] like little bundles of joy and [1410.28s] curiosity always making us laugh and [1413.08s] keeping us on our toes their vitality [1416.00s] certainly brightens up any family [1418.68s] occasion they remind us of the [1420.92s] simplicity and purity of joy plus family [1424.64s] gatherings are where we forge lifelong [1427.88s] memories remember the family picnic last [1430.96s] summer it wasn't just about the food but [1433.64s] about creating moments [1435.52s] together absolutely leo those moments of [1440.56s] camaraderie when we come together they [1443.16s] form the tapestry of our family life [1446.40s] each thread each member contributes to [1450.72s] the beautiful picture of our family so [1455.08s] true every family has its own unique [1458.32s] tapestry woven with stories traditions [1461.72s] and countless shared moments it's what [1464.40s] makes each family special and different [1467.88s]

[1494.44s] generations or that is left for future [1496.92s] generations often involving traditions [1499.92s] values or [1501.44s] property example my grandmother's [1504.04s] recipes are a part of our family's [1505.92s] legacy we still make her famous apple [1508.68s] pie for every family gathering [1512.68s] cheerleaders meaning metaphorically [1515.72s] cheerleaders are people who provide [1517.88s] support encouragement and enthusiasm [1521.68s] typically for someone's efforts or [1524.48s] achievements example when i decided to [1527.24s] start my own business [1528.88s] my family became my cheerleaders always [1531.60s] encouraging me and believing in my ideas [1535.04s] safety net meaning a safety net is a [1539.16s] metaphorical term used to describe a [1541.44s] system or group of people that provides [1544.08s] support security and assistance [1547.12s] especially in times of difficulty [1549.88s] example knowing i have my family as a [1552.44s] safety net gives me the confidence to [1554.44s] take risks and chase my [1556.28s] dreams curiosity meaning curiosity is [1560.72s] the desire to learn or know about [1563.72s] something often characterized by an [1566.08s] inquisitive and exploratory nature [1569.12s] example my nephew's curiosity is endless [1572.76s] he always asks questions about how [1575.12s] things work and loves exploring new [1577.84s] places essence meaning essence refers to [1582.12s] the intrinsic nature or most important [1585.00s] characteristics of something capturing [1587.40s] its fundamental [1589.16s] qualities example the essence of a good [1592.28s] friendship is trust understanding and [1595.76s] mutual respect what does leo say about [1598.68s] the role of traditions in his family leo [1602.16s] mentions that every family gathering in [1604.44s] his family turns into a mini concert [1607.08s] showcasing their inherited musical [1609.68s] talents he highlights this as not just a [1612.52s] tradition but a cherished part of their [1614.96s] family's [1616.00s] heritage how does gwen describe the the [1618.44s] impact of having a support system within [1620.84s] the family gwen explains that the [1623.72s] support system or solidarity within a [1626.64s] family is crucial as it provides [1629.40s] strength and confidence she emphasizes [1632.80s] that it's like having a safety net of [1634.60s] loved ones offering security and support [1638.12s] especially in challenging times [1649.32s] we are told everywhere that we must be [1651.56s] perfect the perfect body the perfect job [1654.96s] the perfect life but perfection is not [1657.56s] real and trying to be perfect can make [1660.44s] us worried and unhappy instead of trying [1663.24s] to be perfect we should accept that we [1665.60s] are not perfect we need to accept [1668.36s] ourselves with all our mistakes and [1670.24s] flaws every mistake we make helps us [1672.84s] learn and grow think about the last time [1675.92s] you really learned something new you [1678.68s] probably made some mistakes first [1681.04s] mistakes are how we learn and understand [1683.16s] more about the world we should not feel [1685.92s] bad or hide our mistakes we should be [1688.48s] happy about them because they mean we [1690.44s] are trying new things the great thing [1693.32s] about not being perfect is that it makes [1695.40s] us different from each other if everyone [1698.00s] was perfect we would all be the same the [1701.12s] world would be boring our mistakes and [1704.24s] imperfections are what make us special [1706.32s] and [1707.12s] interesting so instead of feeling bad [1709.72s] about your mistakes accept them learn [1712.72s] from them grow from them and most [1716.56s] importantly accept yourself as you are [1719.68s] an imperfect but amazing human being [1723.20s] remember the path to true happiness and [1725.64s] fulfillment isn't paved with perfection [1728.52s] it's paved with self-acceptance [1730.84s] self-love and a willingness to embrace [1733.56s] all of the messy imperfect parts of [1735.96s] ourselves that make us who we are are [1738.92s] failure is not bad failure teaches us [1742.52s] important things when we fail we can [1745.00s] learn from our mistakes this helps us [1747.72s] grow and improve we may feel bad at [1750.92s] first but maintaining a positive mindset [1753.76s] is [1754.68s] important see failure as an opportunity [1758.08s] not the [1759.32s] end successful people view failure [1762.40s] differently they treat it as a step on [1764.96s] the path not a stop ask why you failed [1768.92s] and what you can improve maybe you need [1771.92s] more practice maybe you missed some key [1775.56s] steps pinpointing the reason is valuable [1779.08s] knowledge once you understand the cause [1781.96s] make a plan to fix it set concrete goals [1784.84s] for areas to work on take it step by [1787.80s] step checking your progress failing can [1791.16s] expose weaknesses you didn't know about [1793.52s] before this self-awareness is a gift you [1797.48s] can't address a weakness until you [1799.52s] identify it finally celebrate small wins [1803.52s] along the way applaud yourself for [1805.84s] applying lessons from past failures this [1809.00s] positive reinforcement boosts confidence [1811.40s] and [1824.00s] motivation moreover it's important to be [1826.72s] kind to yourself when you make mistakes [1829.36s] do not judge yourself too harshly making [1832.88s] errors is normal and human instead of [1836.76s] criticizing yourself harshly speak to [1839.68s] yourself gently you are learning and [1843.28s] growing mistakes happen as part of this [1846.56s] process they do not make you a [1850.08s] failure think about how you would treat [1852.56s] a good friend who made a mistake you [1855.04s] would understand you would encourage [1858.44s] them give the same compassion to [1860.72s] yourself making harsh judgments can [1863.28s] cause more stress it can make you feel [1865.96s] hopeless or want to give up such a [1868.84s] mindset is not conducive to improvement [1872.24s] when you notice negative selft talk try [1874.72s] to reframe it positively for example i'm [1878.52s] still learning next time i will prepare [1881.48s] more thoroughly treat yourself as you [1884.16s] would a trusted friend above all no that [1888.12s] you are human you will make many [1890.84s] mistakes in life that's [1893.44s] okay have compassion for this imperfect [1897.12s] but beautifully human [1910.20s] experience sometimes we cannot fix [1912.48s] things alone seeking assistance is smart [1915.84s] not a sign of weakness so do do not [1918.28s] hesitate to ask for help when you make a [1920.88s] mistake if you are stuck or confused [1924.12s] consider discussing your situation with [1926.16s] others who may have faced similar [1928.32s] problems their advice could spark new [1931.20s] ideas asking for help demonstrates a [1933.92s] desire to improve and a willingness to [1935.92s] learn qualities that are widely admired [1938.60s] and respected find people you trust who [1942.12s] have more experience mentors teachers or [1945.68s] experienced friends can offer valuable [1948.84s] guidance listen carefully to their [1951.68s] suggestions when asking for help clearly [1954.56s] describe your mistake and provide all [1956.64s] relevant details to ensure others fully [1959.32s] understand the [1960.44s] situation be open-minded to various [1963.04s] solutions the fix might surprise you do [1966.28s] not dismiss unfamiliar ideas as new [1969.28s] approaches can be highly [1971.36s] effective remember needing help is [1974.16s] normal not a failure we all have room to [1977.32s] learn and [1990.80s] grow after a mistake it's important not [1993.60s] to dwell on the past excessively while [1996.40s] looking back can teach lessons becoming [1998.76s] stuck prevents progress if you face [2001.88s] setbacks don't be discouraged expect [2004.96s] obstacles along your journey stay [2007.04s] flexible and adapt your approach as [2009.92s] needed most importantly believe in [2012.40s] yourself and your power to create [2014.40s] positive change build confidence by [2016.96s] recalling past accomplishments that [2019.00s] required [2020.08s] perseverance leave mistakes in the past [2022.52s] where they belong and keep your sights [2024.36s] firmly set on an empowering future one [2027.76s] step at a time you've got this besides [2031.24s] that we also need to recognize the power [2033.92s] of an apology saying i'm sorry takes [2037.48s] courage [2038.44s] but it is very powerful a sincere [2041.60s] apology can heal wounds and rebuild [2044.28s] trust when we make a mistake that [2046.60s] impacts others it is appropriate to [2049.32s] apologize this shows that you understand [2051.96s] you did something wrong an apology [2055.08s] repairs damaged relationships it allows [2058.28s] you to move forward with a clean slate [2060.72s] after making [2061.92s] amends most people will accept an [2064.20s] apology if it seems genuine they will [2067.08s] respect you for having the humility to [2069.16s] admit your error after apologizing it is [2072.44s] time to let go of guilt and shame [2075.44s] holding on to these negative feelings [2078.08s] prevents growth guilt is a normal human [2080.96s] emotion after doing something wrong but [2083.40s] dwelling on it solves nothing forgive [2085.84s] yourself instead [2098.24s] forgiveness is an important part of [2100.04s] moving forward after mistakes it helps [2103.08s] heal pain and prevents carrying [2105.24s] unnecessary burdens first you must [2108.48s] forgive yourself be as compassionate [2111.28s] with yourself as you would be with a [2113.28s] friend holding on to self-blame creates [2116.48s] negativity that weighs you down make [2119.68s] amends if possible but then choose to [2122.24s] let go of guilt forgive yourself for [2125.08s] past errors allowing you to focus pos [2127.76s] positively on the [2129.44s] present additionally strive to [2132.56s] understand the person's perspective even [2135.00s] if you disagree with their [2137.08s] actions consider whether they deserve a [2140.00s] second chance forgiveness does not mean [2142.92s] accepting or excusing bad [2145.44s] behavior it involves releasing the heavy [2148.28s] emotional toll of resentment thereby [2150.96s] freeing you [2152.56s] energetically an unforgiving mindset [2155.16s] creates stress and tension while for [2157.64s] forgiveness allows you to reclaim your [2159.88s] personal power from the [2167.28s] situation no one is perfect everyone [2171.04s] faces challenges and setbacks in life [2174.16s] the key is how you respond when things [2176.16s] go wrong that's called resilience it [2180.12s] means having the strength to get back up [2182.16s] after falling down an important quality [2184.76s] for overcoming mistakes resilient people [2188.20s] view mistakes not as failures but as [2191.24s] lessons to learn from with this mindset [2193.80s] errors become opportunities for growth [2196.80s] when you encounter disappointments allow [2199.00s] yourself to feel the emotions but then [2201.56s] refocus by making a plan to try again [2205.00s] break your goal into smaller steps [2207.76s] tackle it piece by piece with patience [2210.08s] and [2210.84s] determination persistent action is the [2213.52s] path forward ask for support when you [2216.44s] need it having others to lean on can [2218.92s] renew motivation and perspective during [2221.12s] tough times most importantly believe in [2224.64s] your abilities recall past challenges [2227.76s] you overcame through resilience this [2230.44s] boosts confidence in your capacity with [2233.64s] each obstacle you overcome you build [2236.76s] perseverance like exercise overcoming [2239.80s] obstacles strengthens your [2242.20s] resilience use positive words to [2244.52s] encourage yourself and others who are [2246.36s] working through mistakes [2248.52s] criticism fosters more negativity while [2251.20s] reinforcement inspires progress after a [2254.40s] setback do not judge harshly instead [2258.32s] acknowledge the effort made despite the [2260.80s] error for example say i'm proud you [2263.96s] tried your best celebrate small wins [2266.60s] along the journey no matter how [2269.24s] tiny recognizing micro victories [2271.92s] reinforces that you're heading in the [2273.92s] right direction [2282.88s] hello everyone welcome to the learn [2285.04s] english podcast i'm leo and i'm gwen [2289.48s] it's great to see you all again in this [2292.16s] podcast we will explore what true [2294.44s] confidence means we'll explain the [2296.36s] difference between feeling sure in a [2298.12s] healthy way and being too proud or [2300.04s] thinking you're better than others we'll [2302.44s] also discuss where confidence comes from [2305.24s] some factors that build confidence from [2307.88s] inside us like our thoughts and [2310.12s] personalities are you ready to discuss [2312.20s] it today leo totally gwen let's dive [2316.36s] into today's fascinating topic how to [2319.24s] become a confident [2326.36s] person today we're going to talk about [2329.12s] something really important confidence [2332.08s] but before we start let me ask you leo [2334.96s] what does confidence mean to you well [2338.04s] gwen to me confidence is feeling sure [2340.44s] about yourself and your abilities it's [2342.48s] believing that you can do things well [2345.20s] that's a good explanation leo feeling [2348.12s] sure is having a positive belief in your [2351.20s] abilities but gwen do people sometimes [2354.12s] think being confident is the same as [2355.92s] being too proud or feeling better than [2358.40s] others we need to learn the difference [2360.56s] between being confident being too proud [2363.56s] and thinking you are the best confident [2366.80s] is good it means you trust your skills [2369.68s] but you can still learn more being too [2372.00s] proud means you think you are the best [2374.08s] and you are not nice to others thinking [2376.52s] you are better means you think you are [2378.68s] very important i understand so confident [2382.40s] is believing in yourself without putting [2384.16s] others down or thinking you're the best [2387.12s] yes exactly leo feeling sure is feeling [2390.32s] good about yourself but also being [2392.28s] humble and respectful to others that [2395.20s] makes sense can you give an example cool [2398.52s] sure let's say you give a talk in class [2401.20s] if you feel sure you will prepare well [2404.04s] and then speak clearly and look at your [2406.40s] classmates you'll believe you can do a [2408.60s] good job but you won't brag or act [2410.84s] better than everyone so gwen where does [2414.52s] being confident start well leo confident [2417.88s] can come from inside ourselves and from [2419.92s] the world around us and next we'll [2422.44s] discuss how to increase feeling sure by [2424.96s] setting goals we can reach setting goals [2427.64s] that are possible to achieve is very [2429.72s] important for building [2431.44s] confidence i can see why gwen if we set [2435.28s] goals that are too hard we might feel [2437.56s] disappointed when we can't reach them [2439.96s] exactly that's why it's better to set [2442.28s] smaller easier goals first achieving [2445.64s] these goals even if they are small will [2447.92s] make us feel more sure of [2449.88s] ourselves can you give us some tips on [2452.24s] how to set goals we can achieve first [2455.24s] think about what you want to do and why [2457.32s] it's important to you then break that [2460.20s] bigger goal into smaller steps like if i [2463.72s] want to learn a new language i could [2465.60s] first set a goal to learn basic words [2467.96s] and [2468.80s] phrases after achieving that first small [2471.72s] goal you'll feel more confident and can [2474.12s] set a new slightly bigger goal and we [2477.76s] should also make our goals specific and [2479.76s] clear right gwen yes that's a great [2483.16s] point leo unclear goals like get better [2485.92s] at math are hard but a clear goal like [2488.84s] learn the multiplication tables is [2491.40s] easier i got it now set small clear [2495.28s] step-by-step goals to increase confident [2497.36s] as we achieve them one by [2501.44s] one let's look at some related [2504.64s] words one ability meaning the power or [2509.16s] skill to do something example this [2512.68s] program has the ability to adapt to its [2515.16s] user two explanation [2518.36s] meaning a reason given to explain why [2521.08s] something happened example the most [2524.20s] likely explanation is that his plane was [2527.56s] delayed three [2529.84s] personality meaning the combination of [2532.36s] characteristics that make someone unique [2535.48s] example his wife has a strong [2538.52s] personality four goal meaning something [2542.80s] that you want to achieve example you [2545.68s] need to set yourself some long long-term [2548.72s] goals five positive meaning having good [2553.44s] or beneficial qualities example the [2556.96s] contributions have a positive impact on [2559.20s] the lives of hundreds of [2564.76s] children what is the difference between [2566.96s] confident and being too proud answer [2570.72s] feeling sure is having a good belief in [2573.12s] yourself being too proud means you think [2575.52s] you are better than everyone else [2577.72s] feeling sure is good but being too proud [2580.20s] is [2581.20s] bad why is it important to set [2583.36s] achievable goals answer setting goals [2586.80s] that are possible to reach is important [2589.48s] achieving small goals first makes us [2591.28s] feel more sure of ourselves we can then [2593.96s] set bigger goals after feeling [2598.84s] success now let's talk about something [2601.20s] that can make us feel unsure about [2603.16s] ourselves the fear of failing that's a [2606.72s] big problem for many people gwy being [2609.28s] afraid of not doing well can really hurt [2611.32s] our confidence you're absolutely right [2614.08s] leo fear of failure is one of the [2616.60s] biggest things that stops us from being [2618.60s] confident and trying new things it's [2621.52s] almost like that fear stops us and makes [2623.76s] us too scared to even start working [2625.84s] towards our goals exactly but there are [2629.16s] ways we can fight that fear and not let [2631.00s] it control us what strategies would you [2633.64s] suggest for overcoming fear of failure [2636.80s] well leo one helpful thing is to [2639.56s] remember that failing is a normal part [2641.72s] of life everyone fails sometimes when [2644.56s] they try something new failure doesn't [2647.64s] mean we're bad or incapable it just [2650.16s] means we have more to learn right yes [2653.76s] another strategy is to start small just [2656.08s] like we talked about with setting [2657.36s] achievable goals take small steps so any [2660.28s] failures feel smaller and easier to [2662.84s] handle we can also change how we think [2665.48s] about failure in instead of a bad thing [2668.40s] see it as helpful feedback to help us [2670.80s] improve right we can also remind [2673.48s] ourselves of past challenges we overcame [2676.04s] when feeling discouraged building [2678.48s] resilience sounds hard but thinking [2680.56s] about the positive things in our past [2682.24s] successes can really help it certainly [2685.24s] can leo support systems are important [2688.76s] too resilient people build networks to [2691.52s] lean on having family friends teachers [2695.40s] or colleagues who encourage us through [2697.20s] tough times yes exactly don't be afraid [2701.36s] to ask for help resilient people know [2704.40s] they don't have to go through everything [2706.20s] alone thank you gwen i have a much [2709.44s] better understanding of why resilience [2711.36s] matters for self-confidence [2715.44s] now let's look at some new [2718.76s] words one [2721.16s] strategy meaning a plan that is intended [2725.20s] to achieve a particular purpose example [2729.28s] we need to devise an effective long-term [2732.64s] strategy two [2735.16s] incapable meaning not able to do [2738.24s] something example the children seem to [2741.12s] be totally incapable of working by [2743.92s] themselves three [2746.64s] manageable meaning possible to deal with [2749.88s] or control example the debt has been [2753.48s] reduced to a more manageable level four [2757.72s]

me in [3547.80s] the beginning was [3549.16s] routine we all have those little things [3552.24s] we do every day [3554.20s] right maybe it's making your morning [3556.48s] coffee a certain way or

a sense of safety and [3569.76s] comfort speaking of comfort remember [3572.36s] that hobby you love maybe cooking those [3574.76s] delicious meals from home reading a good [3576.96s] book before bed or that yoga routine you [3579.56s] always swear [3580.88s] by keep doing those things they're a [3584.60s] great way to unwind and remind yourself [3587.08s] of the things that make you you [3601.48s] but routine alone isn't enough we all [3604.52s] need connection right this is where [3607.68s] building a new community comes [3610.64s] in think about what you enjoy doing [3613.88s] maybe you love reading playing sports or [3617.52s] volunteering there are probably local [3619.68s] groups or clubs for just about anything [3623.12s] joining one is a fantastic way to meet

you join a club related to your [3640.12s] interests volunteer for a cause you care [3642.96s] about or even just strike up a [3645.44s] conversation with that friendly neighbor [3647.96s] you always [3649.36s] see you might be surprised at how [3651.80s] quickly these connections can grow into [3653.84s] real friendships [3656.44s] here's the thing connecting with others [3658.52s] can be a powerful cure to [3661.48s] loneliness sharing stories laughter and [3664.64s] experiences with new people can bring a [3666.92s] real sense of [3680.52s] belonging let's be honest missing loved [3683.12s] ones figuring out a new place it can all [3686.40s] be a bit [3688.36s] overwhelming but when you take care of [3690.40s] yourself you're building a strong [3692.36s] foundation to handle anything life [3694.68s] throws your [3695.96s] way imagine you're a plant if you don't [3699.60s] get enough water sunshine or good soil [3702.76s] you won't grow strong and [3705.20s] healthy so how do we take care of [3708.68s] ourselves well it's actually the simple [3712.12s] things we often [3714.04s] forget first up food eating healthy [3717.84s] gives your body the energy it needs to
